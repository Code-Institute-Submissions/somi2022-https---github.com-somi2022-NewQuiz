In this project, we have a simple quiz which is made by using, html, css, javascript and, videos. 
We have used a simple temple of html, by creating 5 questions. 3 questions are planned to be answered by writing. 2 questions are planned to be answered by multichoice answers.
I have used html  for styling multichoice question by using type=radio
Whenever the answer is right, in right side you find another box with a video connected based of range 1 to 5 you get. You get your range by clicking on I am finished button.
A massage appears in the same box as videos shows upp.
The range is made by looping system in javascript.
Finally I used css to style the project.
